Robusta, or C. canephora, is a hardier, dare I say, “wilder” coffee bean originally grown in Africa and existing in the same Coffea genus as Arabica beans. In the real world of coffee production, hardier translates to easier to grow at low altitudes, which in turn translates to a lower cost, higher yield cultivation. See “cheaper”. The drawback is that Robustas aren’t nearly as flavorful as Arabicas, producing a bitter, more pungent taste. What are the uses of such an inferior bean? Well, there is a market for harsher tasting coffee. The caffeine content of a Robusta roast is double that of the average Arabica, which might attract those looking to climb the face of Half Dome in half the time. Pure Robusta roasts are beloved by many in the Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam. In fact, Brazil and Indonesia, home of some of the highest quality Arabicas on the planet, grow far more Robustas than Arabicas. The widest use of Robusta is as a filler for mass-produced, Arabica-based coffee blends and – oh dear! - instant coffee. That’s right: many store-bought, canned brands have a high percentage of Robusta blended in to keep the price down. One possible sign of Robusta use in a blend is the mention of Chicory.
